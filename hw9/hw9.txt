i)
Given:
LightSensor=On
SoundSensor=Off

Assumed:
DogBowelTrouble=Yes
HearableBarking=No
DogBarking=No
FamilyHome=No
ExpectingGuests=No
DogOutside=Yes
OutdoorLight=On
SoundSensorHealth=OK
LightSensorHealth=OK
Battery=OK

How:
Using the EM network, set the given variables to their given values.
Show the monitors for the rest of the nodes and assume the value 
with the higher probability.


ii)
Given:
FamilyHome=Yes
ExpectingGuests=No

Assumed:
DogBowelTrouble=Yes
HearableBarking=No
DogOutside=Yes
OutdoorLight=Off
DogBarking=No
SoundSensorHealth=OK
LightSensorHealth=OK
Battery=OK
LightSensor=Off
SoundSensor=Off

How:
Using the EM network, set the given variables to their given values.
Show the monitors for the rest of the nodes and assume the value 
with the higher probability.


iii)
Z={Battery,DogBarking}
There are effectively two paths from sensor to sensor.
One is just battery, the other path involves multiple nodes.
To separate the sensors, we must close at least one valve in each path.
SoundSensor<-Battery->LightSensor becomes closed when Battery is known.
DogOutside->DogBarking->SoundSensor becomes closed when DogBarking is known.
Both paths have a closed valve, thus the sensors are independent.


iv)
This is a multiply-connected network.
